To compile and install SDL:

    1.  Run './configure; make; make install'

        If you are compiling for Windows using gcc, read the FAQ at:
        http://www.libsdl.org/faq.php?action=listentries&category=4#42

        If you are compiling using Visual C++ on Win32, you should read
        the file VisualC.html

    2.  Look at the example programs in ./test, and check out the HTML
        documentation in ./docs to see how to use the SDL library.

    3.  Join the SDL developer mailing list by sending E-mail to
    	sdl-request@libsdl.org
        and put "subscribe" in the subject of the message.

        Or alternatively you can use the web interface:
            http://www.libsdl.org/mailing-list.php

That's it!
