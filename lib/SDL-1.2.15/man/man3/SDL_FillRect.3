.SH "NAME"
SDL_FillRect \- This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with some color
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fB#include "SDL\&.h"
.sp
\fBint \fBSDL_FillRect\fP\fR(\fBSDL_Surface *dst, SDL_Rect *dstrect, Uint32 color\fR);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with \fBcolor\fR\&. If \fBdstrect\fR is \fBNULL\fP, the whole surface will be filled with \fBcolor\fR\&.
.PP
The color should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by the \fISDL_MapRGB\fR or \fISDL_MapRGBA\fR functions\&. If the color value contains an alpha value then the destination is simply "filled" with that alpha information, no blending takes place\&.
.PP
If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via \fISDL_SetClipRect\fR) then this function will clip based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and the \fBdstrect\fR rectangle and the dstrect rectangle will be modified to represent the area actually filled\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
This function returns \fB0\fR on success, or \fB-1\fR on error\&.
