The Powder Toy - boxmein's mod v3
Up to date: version 86.1
Features: 
 * A brainfuck interpreter running on the parts[] array
 * A new element ERAY to do what EDIT was supposed to do. Helps around with automation.

Using Brainfuck

Notes: 
* Commands go into the console.
* There is no standard input and output, ., won't do anything.
* The memory buffer is parts[], so if you loop, make sure your particle indexes go up from 0
	without any gaps.
Basic syntax: !bf [[-]>]
Examples: 
  Delete all particles: [[-]>]
  Up every particle: [+>]
  Down every particle: [->]
  Up every fifth particle twice: [>>>>>++]

Using ERAY

## Values it uses: ##

1. ctype => Determines what kind of element variable (ctype, temperature, velocity, TMP2) gets edited. 
2. tmp => Used for the value of property you're setting. (e.g the element that will be ctype, or the number that'll be the life value)
3. dcolour => Special! Used only in deco editing mode, this will be the "receiving" deco colour. So it'll kinda work like BIZR, passing around its own colour.

## Setting edit modes: ##

Edit modes can be painted on with a brush (it is determined by ctype), also you can use the console (`!set ctype eray BIZR`)  
Here are all the various edit modes: 

	  CLNE => ctype
	  BIZR => dcolour
	  LIFE => life
	  FIRE => temp
	  ACEL => tmp
	  DCEL => tmp2
	  PSCN => vx
	  NSCN => vy
	  CONV => type
	  NONE => destroys the particle you fired at.

Edit mode #1: Deco colours
  2. Paint ERAY with any dcolour you want. That will be used to pass on the colour.

Edit mode #3: Type
	1. Set ERAY's tmp to the desired value. (Old console automatically converts names to ID numbers, 
	   new console needs `tpt.element("name")`)
	2. Using values larger than ~170 will make it loop around and start from 0.

Edit mode #4: Ctype
	1. Set ERAY's tmp to the desired value. (Old console automatically converts names to ID numbers, 
	   new console needs `tpt.element("name")`)
	2. Using values larger than ~170 will make it loop around and start from 0.

Other edit modes: Temp, tmp, tmp2, vx, vy, life
  1. Set ERAY's tmp to the desired value. (Old console automatically converts names to ID numbers, 
	   new console needs `tpt.element("name")`)
