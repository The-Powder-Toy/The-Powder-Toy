HTTP API:
	Make it OO, 
	Use STL (i.e std::string for url, etc)

RequestBroker:
	APIRequest:
		Standard StatusParser and Status object ( {Status: 0, Error = "Danger, Will Robinson!"} )
	Request:
		Some way of identifying multiple requests destined for the same listener

Client/Server API:
	Make more use of APIRequest so we can get rid of the pooey, flakey threading in PreviewView, etc

Interface General:
	Try to use the "Activity" model for some simpler interfaces instead of code-heavy M-V-C
	Move interfaces into separate folder

Interface Elements:
	Vertical Scrolling for Textbox,
