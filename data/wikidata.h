"#LITH:             Lithium ion battery. PSCN activates for discharging the battery while NSCN deactivates and allows\n"
"                   charging. Use INST to store/ use charge. To enable faster charging use .tmp2=1 glows in blue when fast\n"
"                   charging is on. Green-Full, Red-discharged, Blue- Fast charge, White when activated.\n\n"
"#UVRD:             Ultra violet radiations, damages nearby objects.\n"
"#LED:              Light Emmiting Diode,PSCN and NSCN toggles state.(.TMP2=0=white,1=red,2=green,3=blule,4=pink).\n"
"#LNDM:             Landmine, Sensitive explosive.Explodes when detects STKM or STKM2.\n"
"#FUEL:             FUEL, fuel having high calorific value.\n"
"#COND:             Conditioner, sets the temp of surrounding according to its own temp.\n"
"#CLNT:             Coolant, cools down the temp of the system, evaporates at high temperatures.\n"
"#DMRN:             Demron, radioactive shielding material and a better insulator.\n"
"#GLUE:             Glue, melts at 101C, solidifies into SGLUE at temp below 100C.\n"
